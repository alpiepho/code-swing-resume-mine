# code-swing-resume-mine
My own resume derived from code-swing example.

Published at: https://alpiepho.github.io/code-swing-resume-mine/

This is based on a relatively quick tutorial at https://github.com/ornelladotcom/resume-website-workshop.  This was highlighted in a Youtube post on the VS Code channel.

The tutorial was well done, and featured a package, "Code Swing", to help with the GH-Pages publication, so I wanted to try it.  Later I will probably merge features from https://github.com/alpiepho/css-grid-resume-mine (hosted at: https://alpiepho.github.io/css-grid-resume-mine/), like the things in the "Menu".
